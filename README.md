## LL(1) Generation
The purpose of this project is to be able to convert a given context free grammar to an LL(1) grammar.
The context free grammar that I am working with is the TIGER language. 

Grammars that are LL(1) are much easier to parse since it doesn't require any backtracking to parse a given input, 
which is why I am doing this.
